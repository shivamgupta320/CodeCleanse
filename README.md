# Code Cleanse
CodeCleanse aims to automate sophisticated code cleanup process to increase productivity.
Currently supported Code cleanup process is Label Validator.

**Version 1.0.0**

**Label Validator menu**
- Check duplicate values within CustomLabels.labels [1]
- Check all unused labels in complete Repository (pages, classes and lwc) [2]
- Check all labels imported from other repositories [3]
- Check all unused imported Labels in LWC Components [4]

**Assumptions**
> Below assumptions are made for simplification and from code structure point of view.

- `<fullName>...</fullName>` tags are in single line
- `<value>...</value>` tags are in single line
- `*.js-meta.xml` prefix is component directory name
- `*Labels.js` file do not use label

**Notes**
- Before fixing duplicate labels, check if they are already part of managed package.
- Before fixing unused labels, check if other repositories are dependent on it.
